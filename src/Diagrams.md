## Plant UML

Source: https://plugins.gitbook.com/plugin/graphviz-and-plant-uml

This library make break build as it requires 3rd party libs (including Java). The `book.json` config files assumes MacOS file structure.

It's a very powerful library but adds visible latency to documentation build process. It's also initialising desktop Java app for every diagram which distracts workflow. Perhaps it's possible to modify the plugin to initialise Java in background.

###Â Installing 3rd party dependcies on MacOS

```bash
$ brew install graphviz
$ brew install plantuml
```

### Diagram

```puml

' The only difference between actor
'and participant is the drawing
participant Alice
participant "I have a really\nlong name" as L #99FF99
/' You can also declare:
   participant L as "I have a really\nlong name"  #99FF99
  '/
